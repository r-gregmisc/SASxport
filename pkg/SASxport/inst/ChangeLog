	  a list of R
	  object or column names, properly handling case conversion (all
	  converted to upper-case), length restructions (8 characters), and
	  making duplicate names unique. This is not as obvious as it
	  appears,
	  since the process of shortening names can render cause name to
	  become
	  duplicates, and adding digits to the end of names to make them
	  unique
	  can make them too long, so a few iterations may be requireed to
	  ensure
	  valid and unique names.
	* [r1579] Update saved test output files.
	* [r1578] Remove references to Random Technologies LLC and update
	  email address.

	* [r1203] - Use of the attribute named 'format' caused problems
	  with chron
	  objects. Consequently, the format information is now stored in
	  the
	  'SASformat' attribute. For consistency, the input format
	  information
	  is now stored in the 'SASiformat' attribute.
	  
	  - The functions for extracting and setting the format and iformat
	  information have been renamed to 'SASformat' and 'SASiformat',
	  etc.
	  
	  - In order to properly handle SAS format information, we now use
	  a
	  locally modified version of foreign::lookup.xport and
