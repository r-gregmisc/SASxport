This file provides a brief list of major feature enhancements
associated with each package release. For a more detailed list of
changes see the ChangeLog file.

Version 2.1.5
-------------

Use .onAttach() instead of .First.lib() to show startup message.


Version 2.0.6
-------------

Bug fixes:

        * gplots::overplot() - Troels Ring <tring@gvdnet.dk> noted that
          overplot() was reporting 
		Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : couldn't find
		function "lowess.formula"
	  Fixed by changing reference to gplots:::lowess.formula in 
          panel.overplot.

Version 2.0.5
-------------

New functions:

	* gmodels::coefFrame() - Fits a model to each subgroup defined by
 	  \code{by}, then returns a data frame with one row for each
	  fit and one column for each parameter.

Function changes:

	* frameApply() and drop.levels() have been moved to the
	  gdata package from the gtools package.

	* gtools::quantcut() now properly handles cases where
          where more than one quantile obtains the same value.

Bug fixes:

	* Minor change to avoid 'R CMD check' warnings generated by
	  example code for the depreciated gdata::elem() function.

	* Fixed a bug in gtools::mixedsort when only a single value
 	  is provided.


Version 2.0.4
-------------

New functions:

	* ConvertMedUnits.R - Convert Medical measurements between
	  International Standard (SI) and US 'Conventional' Units.

New data:

	* MedUnits data set provides conversions between American
	  US 'Conventional' and Standard Intertional (SI) medical
	  units.

Bug fixes:

	* Fix behavior of ll() with some data types.

	* Minor update to remove 'R CMD check' warnings.

New sub-package:

	* Add a 'gregmisc' subpackage.  This package simply loads
	  all of the other packages.  This should help individuals
	  who are used to the old gregmisc package..


Version 2.0.3
-------------

New functions:

	* gdata::unmatrix - function for converting a matrix into a
	  well-labeled vector

	* gtools::frameApply - Apply a functon the the rows of a data
	  frame.

	* gtools::drop.levels remove unused factor levels from the
	  factors contained in a data frame

Feature enhancements:


        * gdata::ll -  Now handles list-like objects, including data
          frames

	* gmodels::CrossTable - Added 'SPSS' format, as suggested by
  	  Dirk Enzmann

	* gplots::heatmap.2 - 

             - Add new parameters for controlling color key - 

             - New parameter to allow control of height and width of
               separator box

	* gmodels::CrossTable - Show Chisquare contribution of each
	  cell, suggested by Greg Snow.

	* gdata::read.xls - Add ability to specify the perl executable
	  and path.

Bug fixes:

	* gplots::heatmap2 - 

	     - cell note layout was incorrect

	     - Fix handling of rowsep::colsep.

	     - Ignore missing values when computing symmetric range.

	* gplots::bandplot - Fix problem in passing graphical parameters

 	* add import of 'reorder' and 'na.omit' from 'stats' package
 	  to satisfy packages depending on us.

Other changes:

	* gplots::textplot - Code can be simplified because R now
	  supports selecting a fixed width font.

	* gplots::plotmeans - Add more extensive example.

        * gdata::elem - depreciated in favor of gdata::ll


Version 2.0.0
-------------

First release as a package bundle.  Functions are now segregated into four topic-specific packages:

	gplots
	gmodels
	gtool
	gmisc

Thanks to Nitin Jain for doing most of the work of the conversion to
a package bundle.


Version 1.11.2
--------------

- Simpify and fix the build process on both *nix and Windows by simply
  providing pre-built perl modules.


Version 1.11.1
--------------

- Fix building of of gregmisc on Windows:

  Runtime Requirements:

	ActiveState perl in the PATH

  Build Requirements:

	ActiveState perl and Microsoft's NMAKE utility in the PATH
        (A self extracting archive file containing NMAKE is available from
	<ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe>.)

  This was tested on Windows2000 Pro with ActivePerl-5.8.3.809-MSWin32-x86.msi

- (Hopefully) Fix building on Linux with Perl 5.8.0.  Perl 5.8.3 is
  reported to work without error on Linux, as does perl 5.6.1 on Solaris.

Version 1.11.0
--------------

- Bump version number to 1.11.0 to better reflect the production
  status of the package.

- Add read.xls(), a function to read Microsoft Excel files by
  translating them to csv files via the xls2csv.pl script, which has
  also been added to the package.  I've provided scripts to run xls2csv:

     Unix systems: $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/bin/xls2csv
     MS-Windows:   $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/bin/xls2csv.bat

  or you can execute the perl code directly:

     $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/perl/xls2csv.pl

  The perl script explicitly loads its libraries from the installed
  gregmisc so you don't have to worry about paths.  To get usage and
  parameter information, simply execute the script via any of the
  above methods without providing any command-line arguments.


- Improvements to CrossTable() by Marc Schwartz <MSchwartz@MedAnalytics.com>

- Improvements to ooplot() by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker@comcast.net>

- plotCI() and plotmeans() now have improved argument handling.

- The running() function now has an additional parameter `simplify'
  which controls whether the returned values are simplified into a
  vector/matrix or left as a list.

- A makefile that will download and attempt to install all available
  packages from CRAN and Bioconductor is now provided in
  $PACKAGE$/gregmisc/tools/

- space() can now space points along the 'y' dimension.

- Fix an error in the permutations code for repeats.allow=T and r>2.
  Both the bug report and fix are from Elizabeth Purdom
  <epurdom@stanford.edu>.

- Various fixes for compatibility with R 1.9.X.

Version 0.10.2
--------------

- Fixed latex warning.

- Fixed smartlegend() positioning when x and/or y axis are log-scale.

- Add function remove.vars().

Version 0.10.1
--------------

- Fixed bug in textplot() reported by Kevin Wright  <kevin.d.wright at pioneer
  dot com>.

Version 0.10.0
--------------

- Now works with and requires R 1.9.0

- Added ooplot() function that mimics Open-Office style plots.
  Contributed by Lodewijk Bonebakker <bonebakker@comcast.net>

- Fixed bug in running() that arose when the called function
  really neaded a minimum number of elements to work on.

- Added several new features to running(), it can now allow sequences
  shorter than the requested width to be present at the front, the back,
  or on both sides of the full lenth sequences.  This allows one to
  align the data so that the window is before, after, or around the
  indexed point.

- Add enhancements to estimable() provided by Søren Højsgaard
  <sorenh@agrsci.dk>:

  The estimable function now
  1) also works on geese and gee objects and
  2) can test hypotheses af the forb L * beta = beta0 both as a
     single Wald test and row-wise for each row in L.

- Add colorpanel function, which generates a smoothly varying band of
  colors over a three color range (lo, mid, high).
