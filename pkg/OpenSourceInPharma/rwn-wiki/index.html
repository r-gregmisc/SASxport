Here is an initial 'wish list' to get us started:

- Compiled binaries of R and supported packages, in easy to install format (no compilation required!)

    Preferably optimized for the platform: 32bit x86 Linux, 64bit x86 Linux, 32bit x86 Windows, 64bit x86 Windows, Sparc 64bit Solaris

- Support for bugs found in released versions for a specific time window (3 years?)

    We use R as a component of software systems that are not easy to change from a process point of view.  We need to be able to get fixes to bugs for the version of R that we used to construct the system for several years, even if newer versions of R become available.  

- Documentation of the software development lifecycle for R and supported packages

   - Documentation of R Core Team's processes for developing and maintaining R 

   - Documentation of the commercial vendor's process in validating, regression testing, etc of R and supported packages.

- User documentation

- generation of a log file, even for interactive use

- library() command always shows version numbers of packages when loaded
