This section lists features and services that should be provided by an commercial R vendor to improve the *current* use of R.

  Essential

    1. Pre-compiled binaries with installers

       Platforms:

       - Linux (32 and 64 bit)

       - Solaris (32 and 64 bit)

       - Windows (2000 + XP, 32 bit)

       Package contents:

       - Base R

       - Recommended pacakges

       - Key additional packages 

    1. Telephone and email support

       - Installation

       - User issues

    1. library() command should display:

       - Package name

       - Package type (Supported, Unsupported)

       - Packate path

       - Package version

    1. Support for bugs found in released versions for a specific time window (3 years?)

       We use R as a component of software systems that are not easy to change from a process point of view.  We 
       need to be able to get fixes to bugs for the version of R that we used to construct the system for several 
       years, even if newer versions of R become available.  


  Desirable


    1. Central source for R documentation.  Wiki?

    1. Generation of a log file, even for interactive use

    1. Categorization of R packages into quality/support groups with clear requirements for each group:

        - development,

        - testing,

        - production, 

        - supported/peer-reviewed/validated
