**Commercial R Support Wiki!** 

  The purpose of this site is to find out what we want from a commercially supported version of R.  IE, what   
  features, what documentation, what support options, etc. in order to make the best use of R.  I have been 
  talking with both Insightful and Scientific Computing Associates, Inc (SCAI) about this for a couple of years, 
  and both have expressed an interest in providing this service, provided that we can outline exactly what we 
  want.

  I expect that once we have outlined our desires, this information will get propagated to them via three 
  mechanisms:

  1. An explicit "Request for Proposals"

  2. A talk at JSM 2006  in August (Abstract is in GDAS as 2006-1254743 "Open Source Software in Pharmaceutical 
     Research")

  3. Direct discussion with SCAI and Insightful.
