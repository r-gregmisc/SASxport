Current Use of R

  **This section describes how we are *currently* using R.**

  Each entry should consist of a brief title followed by 6 elements:

  Title

    1. Who is the client?

    1. What is the need?

    1. Who does the work?

    1. What technical tasks is R used to accomplish?

    1. What R packages are used?

    1. Who are you? (IE who provided this entry,)

  Pharmacogenomics

    1. Molecular Profiling

    2. Analysis of genetic data, including whole-genome SNP profiling (100K+ SNPs)

    3. Statistical Applications

    4. Exploritory data analysis (EDA), visualization, report generation, hypothesis testing, data manipulation 
     linear modeling, prediction

    5. genetics, GeneticsBase, nws, Rlsf, qvalue

    6. Greg Warnes

  Gene Expression Microarrays

    1. Discovery Scientists

    2. Pre-processing (normalization, summarization, scaling) and analysis of gene expression data

    3. Genomic and Proteomics Sciences (Discovery) and Research Statistics

    4. Exploritory data analysis (EDA), visualization, report generation, hypothesis testing, data manipulation 
       linear modeling, prediction, mostly via MiDAS (Microarray Data Analysis System)

    5. RAffyTool (internal), Biobase, Design, multcomp, gtools (>= 2.1.1), gplots, multtest, Design, MASS
       Rlsf, affy, gdata, gmodels, gplots, gtools, multcomp, multtest, nlme, stats
