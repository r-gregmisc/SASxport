Abstract:

The RForge project proposes to develop an internet portal that provides
add-on package developers with the same types of tools that are
available to the developers of the core R environment, and to
institute a system for clearly categorizing packages according to
their development status.  This will encourage package developers to
utilize a standard software lifecycle, which will increase the overall
quality of contributed R packages, will make it easier to determine
which package may be appropriately used in specific circumstances, and
will ultimately make it possible to validate a set of well-supported
packages for use in regulated environments.
